# Float pow(Float base, Float exp)

The pow function returns base raised to the expth power.

If the base is zero and exp is less than or equal to zero, or the base is negative and exp is not an integer, an invalid float like -1.#IND0 will be returned

If the result is too large an invalid float like 1.#INF0 will be returned.

* **base:** The base.
* **exp:** The exponent.
* **Returns:** The base raised to the expth power.
