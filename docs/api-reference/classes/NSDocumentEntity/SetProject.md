# SetProject(NSProject project)

A document may also be connected to a project, so you see the document both on the company card, and on the project card. This does not mean however that a project is required.

**Parameter:** 
 - **project** NSProject

```crmscript
NSDocumentEntity thing;
NSProject project;
thing.SetProject(project);
```
