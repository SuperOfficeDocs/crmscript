# NSConfiguration

This service supports fetching of client interface configuration data. Client configuration data include Application configuration, which defines how an application is composed out of pages; and page configuration that defines how a page is built out of panels, cards, views and controls. <para/> Separate access points also exist for fetching object mappings and filter lists.
