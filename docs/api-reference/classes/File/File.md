# File
>[!Note]
> This class is not available in CRM Online.

This represents a file.

Use open before you call any other methods.

## Example

    File f;
    
    f.open("test.txt", "a+"); // Opening file appending (and creating)
    f.write("test");
    f.close(); // Closing the file when done writing
    
    File g;
    
    g.open("test.txt", "r"); // Opening file for reading only
    print(g.readAll());
    g.close();
