# NSTooltips

This service provides tooltips. It is based on 'tooltip hints', strings that may eiehter be a tooltip text (if provided by someone else), or a set of key/value pairs or other specification.<para />The tooltip implementation is plugin based, and tooltip hints are passed to all registered plugin providers according to certain rules. It is therefore up to providers to parse and process tooltip hints as they see fit.
