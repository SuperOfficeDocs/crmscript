PluginUrlResponse exists to be able to respond with more than just a true/false, but also an explanation. Such an explanation can be displayed on for instance a disabled “Place Order” button. In addition, an URL can be returned, which the GUI should navigate to/display if it is non-blank. The URL can be an SoProtocol or http(s)
