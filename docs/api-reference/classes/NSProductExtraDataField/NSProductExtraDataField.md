# NSProductExtraDataField

A way to show some simple extra data on a product, typically to hep the user to identify the correct product. Basically a bucket of additional info that the ERP system would like to store and show in the user interface. Information placed here is shown in the GUI if the “provide-extra-data” capability is true.
