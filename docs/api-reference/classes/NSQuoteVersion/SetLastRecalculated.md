# SetLastRecalculated(DateTime lastRecalculated)

When this version was last subjected to a total recalculation. This field must be set by the connector, since the connector may choose to ignore a RecalculateVersion call based on policies and possibly the current value of this field. SuperOffice will set this field to 1.1.1760 whenever any change occurs to the quote, to indicate that a recalculation is needed.

**Parameter:** 
 - **lastRecalculated** DateTime

```crmscript
NSQuoteVersion thing;
DateTime lastRecalculated;
thing.SetLastRecalculated(lastRecalculated);
```
