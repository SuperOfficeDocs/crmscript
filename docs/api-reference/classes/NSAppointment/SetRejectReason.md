# SetRejectReason(String rejectReason)

Why was this booking or assignment rejected, the RejectReason list is a source of suggestions but you can write anything here

**Parameter:** 
 - **rejectReason** String

```crmscript
NSAppointment thing;
String rejectReason;
thing.SetRejectReason(rejectReason);
```
