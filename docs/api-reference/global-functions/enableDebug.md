# enableDebug

Enable debugging for the current script, with the given debugId. If the executing environment contains the same debugId, then this script will enter debug mode. To set the debugId in a browser, use the "?action=debug" parameter. This functionality is designed to allow for debugging scripts which are operative. I.e. it is possible to debug a script, while it will continue to run as normal for other users.

* **debugId:** A string which will be compared with the debugId in the executing environment.
